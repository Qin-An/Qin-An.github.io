Welcome to my homepage! My name is Qin An. I am currently working as a computational biologist at biopharma industry, where I am applying my unique combination of expertise in biology, statistics, and machine learning, to develop new medicines that help patients around the world.  

I obtained my Ph.D. in Human Genetics from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). While at there, my research focused on:
* developing new computational pipelines and algorithms, to process, analyze, and interpret various types of NGS data
* generating novel biological insights and actionable hypothesis, by analyzing large-scale, complex biological datasets

Outside work, I am a self-styled professional cook 🧑‍🍳, a kitty parent 🐈‍⬛, and an enthusiast in road trip 🏕️.
